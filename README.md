# üêå NuMPItron

Simplistic small language model 3D-parallelism training using NumPy and MPI. Inspired by [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) and [Nanotron](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron) and based only on [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [MPI for Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io), NuMPItron offers a variety of ways to train your Transformer at a snail's pace.

# Core Features

We support the following:
- Single Core Training
- Tensor Parallelization (Megatron-LM style)

We will soon support the following:
- Sequence Parallelization (Megatron-LM style)
- DataParallel

And on the roadmap is:
- Ring Attention
- ZeRO



# Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lweitkamp/numpitron.git
cd numpitron
pip install -e .
```

# Examples

You can run a sample character level training run on the shakespeare corpus using:
```bash
python train.py --save_dir examples
```

This will save both the model (`examples/model.state`) and the optimizer (`examples/optimizer.state`) to be used for sampling.
Be advised that training for about 10 epochs took 24+ hours on my 2015 macbook pro, with a loss of about ~1.80.
I would not recommend training from scratch but to download  the states from [google drive URL] to the `examples` folder.

And run a sample generation using:
```bash
python sample.py --model_dir examples/model.state
```

With the state loaded from google drive we can generate the following text:

```
